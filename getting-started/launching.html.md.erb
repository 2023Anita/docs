For many languages and frameworks, you can deploy your app straight from source. `fly launch` can scan your source code and deploy your app to Fly.io with a preset configuration. You pick an app name and an initial deployment region, and flyctl does the rest.

It's also easy to [bring your Heroku app to Fly.io](/launch/turboku) [Turboku](https://fly.io/launch/heroku) web launcher. Read about it in the [New Turboku launch post](https://fly.io/blog/new-turboku/).

Check out our other [Web Launchers](/launch).

For other kinds of projects, and for finer control over your project configuration, you can use a Docker image or your own Dockerfile.
