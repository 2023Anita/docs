**Fly.io is a global application delivery network. We run fleets of servers that turn your code into virtual machines running close to your users around the world. We are here for two things: low latency and great DX.**

We're in 23 regions around the world, and counting. Putting your apps right next to your users makes them respond faster, and we are going hard on bringing your apps to hardware in more parts of the world. 

But we also want to be the best place to run your full stack, wherever you run it&mdash;be it a simple web service or your database-backed opus with multiple supporting services.
